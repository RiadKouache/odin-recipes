    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses: </strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>
